Today in class we covered testing in python with pytest. 
Initially, the windows users ran into issues with setting up the virtual environment, but we figured out the correct commands.
We went through the first five tutorials and read about the testing concepts each tutorial covered. We covered basic syntax, assertions, 
exception raising and handling, and fixutres.
