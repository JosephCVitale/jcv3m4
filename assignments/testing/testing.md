# Python Testing
We went over the basics of python testing with pytest. 
In tutorial 1, we learned that a test must start with test in the name. Then when pytest runs the file with the test, it determines if the test passes or fails. 
In tutorial 2, we learned that tests can assert some statement. The test passes when the statement is true and fails when the statement is false. 
In tutorial 3, we saw that you can assert that an error occurs using pytest.raises, and then handle it within the test. The test passes if the exception is raised and handled, and fails if it is not raised or handled.
In tutorial 4, we went over fixtures.
